# Shared Files Analysis and Consolidation Plan

## Current Status

### File Sizes
- SharedUtilities.html: 1,670 lines (largest)
- SharedModals.html: 1,951 lines
- SharedErrorHandling.html: 171 lines
- SharedTailwindConfig.html: 56 lines
- SharedSecurityHeaders.html: 42 lines

### Key Classes in SharedUtilities.html
- DebounceManager (line 182)
- ThrottleManager (line 212)
- DOMUtilities (line 258)
- EnhancedCache (line 345)
- ErrorHandler (line 451)
- LoadingManager (line 513)
- GASUtilities (line 553)
- SecurityUtilities (line 647)
- PrivacyLogger (line 682)

## Consolidation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Low Risk Merges
1. **SharedTailwindConfig.html** (56 lines) → Can be merged into SharedUtilities.html
2. **SharedSecurityHeaders.html** (42 lines) → Can be merged into SharedUtilities.html

### Phase 2: Medium Risk Merges
1. **SharedErrorHandling.html** (171 lines) → Potential overlap with ErrorHandler class in SharedUtilities

### Phase 3: High Risk - Requires Careful Planning
1. **SharedModals.html** (1,951 lines) → Large, complex, likely has unique functionality

## Next Steps
1. Defer consolidation until after critical bug fixes
2. Focus on current architecture violations first
3. Plan SharedUtilities refactoring as separate project phase

## Status: DEFERRED
Reason: Risk vs benefit analysis shows current shared file structure is functional, consolidation can wait until after critical fixes are completed.
