# Deploy Safe Command

## Description
Safe deployment workflow with comprehensive pre-deployment validation.

## Usage
```
/deploy-safe [environment]
```

Options:
- `staging` - Deploy to staging environment
- `prod` - Deploy to production (requires approval)

## Implementation

This command performs the following workflow:

### 1. Pre-deployment Validation
```bash
npm run test:coverage    # Ensure 90%+ test coverage
npm run lint            # Zero ESLint errors/warnings
npm run format          # Auto-fix formatting issues
```

### 2. Architecture Health Check
- Service layer integrity validation
- Database connection verification
- Cache system functionality test
- Error handling system check

### 3. Security Audit
- Input validation testing
- Authentication flow verification
- Permission system validation
- XSS/injection protection test

### 4. Performance Validation
- Response time benchmarks (<3s)
- Memory usage limits (<128MB)
- Cache hit rate validation (>80%)
- Service diagnostics green

### 5. Deployment Execution
```bash
# Staging deployment
clasp push --force

# Production deployment (with approval)
echo "Production deployment requires manual approval"
read -p "Continue? (y/N): " confirm
[[ $confirm == [yY] ]] && clasp push --force
```

## Safety Features

- **Rollback Plan**: Automatic backup before deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Post-deployment system validation
- **Error Tracking**: Real-time error monitoring setup
- **Performance Alerts**: Automatic performance regression detection

## Expected Output
