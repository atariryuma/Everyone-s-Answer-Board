Security Note: 
1. iframe sandbox warnings about "allow-scripts and allow-same-origin" are generated by Google Apps Script's 
   iframe implementation and cannot be controlled by user code. This is a known limitation of the GAS environment.
2. The warning "An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin can escape its sandboxing" 
   is expected in GAS environment as both flags are required for proper functionality.
3. Permissions Policy above explicitly disables problematic features (ambient-light-sensor, speaker, vibrate, vr)
   to reduce console warnings while maintaining security.
4. These warnings do not impact application functionality or security in the GAS context.
