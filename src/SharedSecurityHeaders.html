Security Note: 
1. iframe sandbox warnings about "allow-scripts and allow-same-origin" are generated by Google Apps Script's 
   iframe implementation and cannot be controlled by user code. This is a known limitation of the GAS environment.
2. The warning "An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin can escape its sandboxing" 
   is expected in GAS environment as both flags are required for proper functionality.
3. The Permissions Policy is kept minimal to avoid "Unrecognized feature" console messages.
4. Some warnings may still appear from the parent/container frames and are outside this page's control.
